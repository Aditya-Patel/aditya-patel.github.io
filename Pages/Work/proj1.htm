<h2>Project 1: Design Change Testing</h2>

<p>
	After I was put through the required training for interns, I was immediately put to work in testing. Microscan made a recent change to one of their scanner guns, and I was to test the accuracy of the read of the scanner on a sample of 100 samples and surfaces that were traditionally difficult for scanners to read, surfaces like curved surfaces, indented surfaces, colored surfaces, dark surfaces, among other surfaces. I tested a total of 25 scanners on the samples, and collected data from the samples as a hit-or-miss in an Excel worksheet, in which I had created a formula to indicate the read percentage for the individual scanner, and compared the results per scanner for each sample.

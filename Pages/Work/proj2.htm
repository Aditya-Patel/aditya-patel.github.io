<h2>Project 2: Conveyor Mount and ESP vs. Dataman Testing</h2>
<p>
	During the summer, this was my main project. I was given computer aided design software so I could generate a sketch for a conveyor belt rig to test two cameras at the same time. I spent about a total of five to six weeks on this project, and two of those weeks went into just CADing the design for the rig. Afterwards, I machined and built the actual rig, and then mounted a Microscan product and a competitor's product, to test the operating software for each scanner.

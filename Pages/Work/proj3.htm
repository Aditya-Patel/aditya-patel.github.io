<h2>Project 3: Keyence and Dataman Setup Test</h2>
<p>
	This was my last project at Microscan. I was given two more scanners that were different from the previous two scanners. The task was ultimately the same, as I tested the two scanners for their operating software. However, the final part of the task was to make a presentation that compiles my findings from all of the scanner tests and combine it into a presentation.
